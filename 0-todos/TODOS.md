                            - ```
                            <head>

                    - [✔️] Complete MDN’s Active Learning sections on DOM manipulation and test your skills!
                    - [✔️] Read the following sections from JavaScript Tutorial’s series on the DOM to get a broader idea of how events can be used in your pages.
                        - [✔️] https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-events/

            - [✔️] Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors
                - [✔️] UI
                    - [✔️] For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
                    - [✔️] Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
                    - [✔️] Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
                    - [✔️] Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
                    - [✔️] You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.
            - [✔️] Project: Etch-a-Sketch
                - [✔️] Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
                    - [✔️] Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try to create them by hand by copying and pasting them in your HTML file!
                    - [✔️] It’s best to put your grid squares inside a “container” div. This div can be written in your HTML file.
                    - [✔️] Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Despite the name, do not be tempted to research or use CSS Grid, as it will be taught in a later lesson after the foundations path. This project is an opportunity specifically to practice Flexbox!
                    - [✔️] Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares!
                    - [✔️] “OMG, why isn’t my grid being created???”
                    - [✔️] Did you link your CSS stylesheet?
                    - [✔️] Open your browser’s developer tools.
                    - [✔️] Check if there are any errors in the JavaScript console.
                    - [✔️] Check your “elements” panel to see if the elements have actually shown up but are somehow hidden.
                    - [✔️] Go willy-nilly and add console.log statements in your JavaScript to see if it’s actually being loaded.
